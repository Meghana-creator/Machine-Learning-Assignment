# Machine-Learning-Assignment
Develop a machine learning pipeline to predict mycotoxin levels (DON concentration) in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data. This assignment tests your ability to preprocess complex data, build and optimize regression models, and design code that is modular and production-ready.


This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict DON concentration in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data. It includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and outlier removal.
Model Training: Random Forest & Neural Network with hyperparameter tuning (Optuna).
Evaluation: Regression metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²), SHAP analysis.
Deployment: Flask API for real-time predictions.
Production-Ready Features: Unit testing, logging, and Docker containerization.
